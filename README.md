This is my professional Data portfolio. 

The first file, named One Million, although it is a .ipynb file, you can visualize the code. 
If you want to check whether the code is running, so the most efficient tool in this case is Jupyter Notebooks (or Jupyter Labs). 
For that, it's highly recommended to use Anaconda browser, with Jupyter Notebooks/Labs installed. 

The second file is Power BI dashboard created for a fictional business called BikeStoreProject. In it I use SQL Server to edit queries and then upload them to PBI.
